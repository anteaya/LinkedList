#
# Yes - there are supposed to be 2 1's
#
# 0) Fork this Github Project
#
# 1) in your fork
#    1) break README, NODE, and LIST into 3 files - Readme, node.rb, and list.rb
#    2) create 2 test files - one for node and one for list
#
# 1) Write empty test wrappers for each of the methods in described in the class
#
# 2) for each of the test wrappers marked #:record_attr
#    1) design assertions according to comment about method - failing test
#    2) write code - passing test
#
# 3) for each of the rest of the test wrappers
#    1) design assertions according to comment about method - failing test
#    2) write code - passing test
#
# 5) implement tests for the following scenarios
#    1) find first node which has the value 'a'
#    2) find all nodes which have the value 'z'
#    3) sort a list
#       1) each of the nodes in the List will have a number (n > 0 < n)
#       2) this method will re-order a copy of the list
#       3) hint => use message 'dup' to make a copy of an object
#
# 8) implement methods for the tests in step 5
#
# BONUS POINTS
# 
# 13) add a test for a class method to List with the following interface
#
#   class << self
#     def fibonacci(length)
#       # return 'length' elements of fibonacci sequence
#     end
#   end
# 
# 21) think of a common alternative name for :
#
#   'insert_next'
#   'remove_next'
#   'insert_begining'
#   'remove_begining'
#
#   Hint - What are Stack operations?
#
#   (method-rename:refactor)
#   Refactor your test and then your code to use your new names
