#
# Yes - there are supposed to be 2 1's
#
# 0) Fork this Github Project
#
# 1) in your fork
#    1) break README, NODE, and LIST into 3 files - Readme, node.rb, and list.rb
#    2) create 2 test files - one for node and one for list
#
# 1) Write empty test wrappers for each of the methods in described in the class
#
# 2) for each of the test wrappers marked #:record_attr
#    1) design assertions according to comment about method - failing test
#    2) write code - passing test
#
# 3) for each of the rest of the test wrappers
#    1) design assertions according to comment about method - failing test
#    2) write code - passing test
#
# 5) implement tests for the following scenarios
#    1) find first node which has the value 'a'
#    2) find all nodes which have the value 'z'
#    3) define a 'sort' method for the List object
#       1) each of the nodes in the List will have a number (n > 0 < n)
#       2) calling sort on the List object will return a new list
#       3) the original list will still be unsorted
#
# 8)pers marked #:record_attr
#    1) design assertions according to comment about method - failing test
#    2) write code - passing test
#
# 3) for each of the rest of the test wrappers
#    1) design assertions according to comment about method - failing test
#    2) write code - passing test
#
# 5) implement tests for the following s   newNode.next := node.next
  #    node.next    := newNode
  #
  def insert_after_me(new_node)
    # return self
  end
